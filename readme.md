- Stop Words Removal
- Lemmatization and Stemming

**Objectives:**
- Implement text preprocessing pipelines.
- Prepare textual data for analysis and retrieval.

**Code Example:**
```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

def preprocess_text(text):
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [t.lower() for t in tokens]
    tokens = [t for t in tokens if t.isalpha()]
    tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stopwords.words('english')]
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in tokens]
    return tokens
```

### Lab 4: Semantic Analysis with NLTK

**Topics Covered:**
- Understanding Semantic Relationships
- Utilizing WordNet for Synonyms and Definitions
- Enhancing Text Comprehension

**Objectives:**
- Analyze semantic relationships within text data.
- Utilize NLTK's WordNet to enrich data with semantic information.

**Code Example:**
```python
from nltk.corpus import wordnet

def get_synonyms(word):
    synonyms = set()
    for syn in wordnet.synsets(word):
        for lemma in syn.lemmas():
            synonyms.add(lemma.name())
    return synonyms
```

### Lab 5: Cloud Deployment of Retrieval Systems
